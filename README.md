**Idea**
Security in Sharing economy

**Problem**
Ordering certain services on p2p platforms, we are faced with the lack of security and inadequacy of the people who provide these services. This applies to such services as taxis, babysitters, home services, housing rentals, etc. Sometimes it can even endanger people's lives.

**Solution**
Perform a psychological analysis of the service provider's adequacy when registering on a p2p platform using Ai's approaches for voice recognition, video recognition or response to a specific photo or video content.

**Example of implementation**
When registering on a platform, we suggest a person to pass the test and show certain content. These can be pictures or videos of different content (joy, children, horrors, war, violence, etc.). We automatically fix the response to this content using the frontal cellphones camera. The neural network analyzes this response based on the trained model of psychoanalysis and assigns a particular rating or psychotype to the user. This rating can be displayed for a customer of p2p service, affect the rating of performers or even be a ground for refusing to provide services on the platform. Next, this service provider profile can be extended to other platforms where the user is registered. A similar solution can be used for clients of p2p services.
In this way, we can increase the security of p2p services.
